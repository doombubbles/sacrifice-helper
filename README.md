<h1 align="center">Sacrifice Helper</h1>

Adds displays for Sun Avatars and Sun Temples that show what the current sacrifice amounts would be for each tower type.

Also adds a display for upgrading to a Paragon Tower for what degree it will be, and lets you confiure the sacrifice weights.

Additionally, this mod adds an option for the Sacrifices to not happen. You'll see a button in the place where the Ambidextrous Rangs buttons are to let you turn the sacrificing on or off.

By default, it also substantially reduces the price of these upgrades when not sacrificing, since un-sacrificed temples and gods aren't actually all that impressive. The prices $50,000 for Sun Temple and $100,000 for True Sun God by default, but those are configurable. (From some basic testing, those might even be a bit high, actually).

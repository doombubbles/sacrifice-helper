- Internal revamp of UI code
- Added paragon bonus power indicator (from those Geraldo items)
- You can now click on the paragon power indicator icons to be told your progress toward the maximum
- Fixed issue with Paragon sacrifices not destroying towers
- Fixed issue with degree calculations for extra tier 5 towers (apparently the upgrade cost of the Paragon starts being included in the sacrifice once you have more than three tier 5s lol)
